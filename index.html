  I work as a Data Scientist in Search, Data Mining &amp; Personalization group at Groupon, Palo Alto. My work involves mining vast amount of user and product data to inform search relevance and user personalization. Details about some of the work I am doing here can be found <a href="https://deependra230.github.io/projects#query-click">here</a>.

  Lately, I have become very interested in Computational Genomics, in particular its applications to Systems Biology, especially in infering gene regulatory networks. To this end, I took a couple of courses to make myself more acuqainted with the field: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-biology-secret-life-mitx-7-00x-4"> Introduction to Biology at Coursera</a> by Prof. Eric Lander of MIT, and Next Generation DNA Sequencing: Methods and Applications at <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/">UCSC-Silicon Valley Extension</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abizar"> Prof. Abizar Lakdawalla</a>. These courses greatly stimulated my interest and led me to undertake a project that encompassed both Machine Learning and Genomics; in that I applied decision tree algorithm to train a classifier to distinguish between protein coding and noncoding regions on Human DNA sequences of varying lengths (<a href="https://deependra230.github.io/projects#locating-coding-regions">details here</a>). I wish to pursue graduate study in this field: that is, applying statistical, data mining and machine learning methods to the problems in genomics domain, and identify insights into development, disease and evolution. Who knows, maybe achieving the milestone of personalized genomic medicine is not too far for humankind.

  I completed my graduation from <a href="http://iitd.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</a> (IIT Delhi) in May, 2014. My major was <a href="http://cse.iitd.ac.in/">Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a>. I was youngest of the graduating class of 2014 having completed my bachelor's degree at the age of 19. Prior to joining Groupon at their Palo Alto office, I worked in the Chennai office from June 2014 to September 2015.
