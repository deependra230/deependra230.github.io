I am a computer science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania being advised by Dr. Yoseph Barash. My primary interests are in machine learning and its applications to genomics. 

Before starting my graduate studies in 2017, I spent three wonderful years at Groupon (roughly, half the time in India, and half in United States) where I worked on search relevance and recommendation systems.  I consider myself very fortunate to have worked under the supervision of Dr. Rajesh Parekh and Dr. Vinay Deolalikar.
